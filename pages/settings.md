Change language of this page: [English](settings.html), [German](settings-de.html)

<!-- ltex: language=en-US -->

## `ltex.enabled`

Controls whether the extension is enabled. Allows disabling LanguageTool on specific workspaces or for specific code language modes (i.e., file types).

Either supply a Boolean value stating whether LTeX is enabled for all supported markup languages or disabled for all of them, or supply a list of [code language identifiers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers) for which LTeX should be enabled (note that extensions can define additional code language identifiers).

All supported markup languages are listed in the default value of this setting. In addition, LTeX can check comments in many popular programming languages like C++ or Java, if you add the corresponding code language identifiers to this setting. If you add an unsupported code language mode, LTeX will check corresponding files as plain text without any parsing.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

The activation events are unaffected by this setting. This means that the extension will be activated whenever a file with a supported code language mode is opened. For unsupported code language modes, you may need to activate the extension explicitly by executing the [`LTeX: Activate Extension`](vscode-ltex/commands.html#ltex-activate-extension) command.

Changes require restarting LTeX to take effect.

</div>

## `ltex.language`

The language (e.g., `"en-US"`) LanguageTool should check against. Use a specific variant like `"en-US"` or `"de-DE"` instead of the generic language code like `"en"` or `"de"` to obtain spelling corrections (in addition to grammar corrections).

When using the language code `"auto"`, LTeX will try to detect the language of the document. This is not recommended, as only generic languages like `"en"` or `"de"` will be detected and thus no spelling errors will be reported.

*Type:* `string`

*Possible values:*

- `"auto"`: Automatic language detection (not recommended)
- `"ar"`: Arabic
- `"ast-ES"`: Asturian
- `"be-BY"`: Belarusian

## `ltex.dictionary`

Lists of additional words that should not be counted as spelling errors.

This setting is language-specific, so use an object of the format `{"<LANGUAGE1>": ["<WORD1>", "<WORD2>", ...], "<LANGUAGE2>": ["<WORD1>", "<WORD2>", ...], ...}`, where `<LANGUAGE>` denotes the language code in [`ltex.language`](settings.html#ltexlanguage).

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

This setting is a multi-scope setting. [See the documentation for details.](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/vscode-ltex/setting-scopes-files.html#multi-scope-settings)

This setting supports external files (when used in VSCode, the language server does not support them). [See the documentation for details.](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/vscode-ltex/setting-scopes-files.html#external-setting-files)

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

By default, no additional spelling errors will be ignored.

*Type:* `object`

*Example:* `{"en-US": ["adaptivity", "precomputed", "subproblem"], "de-DE": ["B-Splines", ":/path/to/externalFile.txt"]}`

*Default:* `{}`

## `ltex.hiddenFalsePositives`

Lists of false-positive diagnostics to hide (by hiding all diagnostics of a specific rule within a specific sentence).

This setting is language-specific, so use an object of the format `{"<LANGUAGE1>": ["<JSON1>", "<JSON2>", ...], "<LANGUAGE2>": ["<JSON1>", "<JSON2>", ...], ...}`, where `<LANGUAGE>` denotes the language code in [`ltex.language`](settings.html#ltexlanguage) and `<JSON>` is a JSON string containing information about the rule and sentence.

Although it is possible to manually edit this setting, the intended way is the `Hide false positive` quick fix.

The JSON string currently has the form `{"rule": "<RULE>", "sentence": "<SENTENCE>"}`, where `<RULE>` is the ID of the LanguageTool rule and `<SENTENCE>` is a Java-compatible regular expression. All occurrences of the given rule are hidden in sentences (as determined by the LanguageTool tokenizer) that match the regular expression. [See the documentation for details.](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/advanced-usage.html#hiding-false-positives-with-regular-expressions)

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

This setting is a multi-scope setting. [See the documentation for details.](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/vscode-ltex/setting-scopes-files.html#multi-scope-settings)

## `ltex.bibtex.fields`

List of BibTeX fields whose values are to be checked in BibTeX files.

This setting is an object with the field names as keys (not restricted to classical BibTeX fields) and Booleans as values, where `true` means that the field value should be checked and `false` means that the field value should be ignored.

Some common fields are already ignored, even if you set this setting to an empty object.

*Type:* `object`

*Example:* `{"maintitle": false, "seealso": true}`

*Default:* `{}`

*Full type description:* <button class='expandable-button btn btn-default'>Click to show/hide</button>

<div markdown='1' style='display:none;'>

Object with arbitrary property names, where the value of each property has the following type:

- Scalar of type `boolean`

</div>

## `ltex.latex.commands`

List of LaTeX commands to be handled by the LaTeX parser, listed together with empty arguments (e.g., `"\ref{}"`, `"\documentclass[]{}"`).

This setting is an object with the commands as keys and corresponding actions as values.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

If you edit the `settings.json` file directly, don't forget to escape the initial backslash by replacing it with two backslashes. If you use the VS Code Settings panel, only type one backslash.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

Many common commands are already handled by default, even if you set this setting to an empty object.

*Type:* `object`

*Example:* `{"\\label{}": "ignore", "\\documentclass[]{}": "ignore", "\\cite{}": "dummy", "\\cite[]{}": "dummy"}`

*Default:* `{}`

*Full type description:* <button class='expandable-button btn btn-default'>Click to show/hide</button>

<div markdown='1' style='display:none;'>

Object with arbitrary property names, where the value of each property has the following type:

- One of the following values:

  - `"default"`: The command is treated like unknown commands are treated by default: The command name itself is ignored, but the arguments are not ignored.
  - `"ignore"`: The whole command together with its arguments is ignored.
  - `"dummy"`: The whole command together with its arguments is replaced with a dummy word (i.e., `Dummy0`, `Dummy1`, etc.). LTeX internally uses this mechanism for equations, citations, references, and similar constructs that are part of the sentence structure and for which LanguageTool would throw an error if simply omitted from the checked text.
  - `"pluralDummy"`: The whole command together with its arguments is replaced with a plural dummy word (i.e., `Dummies`). See description for `"dummy"`.
  - `"vowelDummy"`: The whole command together with its arguments is replaced with a vowel dummy word (i.e., `Ina`). See description for `"dummy"`.

</div>

## `ltex.latex.environments`

List of names of LaTeX environments to be handled by the LaTeX parser.

This setting is an object with the environment names as keys and corresponding actions as values.

Some environments are already handled by default, even if you set this setting to an empty object.

*Type:* `object`

*Example:* `{"lstlisting": "ignore", "verbatim": "ignore"}`

*Default:* `{}`

*Full type description:* <button class='expandable-button btn btn-default'>Click to show/hide</button>

<div markdown='1' style='display:none;'>

Object with arbitrary property names, where the value of each property has the following type:

- One of the following values:

  - `"default"`: The environment is treated like unknown environments are treated by default: The arguments of the environment are ignored, but the contents of the environment are not ignored.
  - `"ignore"`: The whole environment together with its arguments and contents is ignored.

</div>

## `ltex.markdown.nodes`

List of Markdown node types to be handled by the Markdown parser.

This setting is an object with the node types as keys and corresponding actions as values.

The Markdown parser constructs an AST (abstract syntax tree) for the Markdown document, in which all leaves have node type `Text`. The possible node types are listed in the [documentation of flexmark-java](https://javadoc.io/static/com.vladsch.flexmark/flexmark/0.62.2/com/vladsch/flexmark/ast/package-summary.html).

Some common node types are already handled by default, even if you set this setting to an empty object.

*Type:* `object`

*Example:* `{"CodeBlock": "ignore", "FencedCodeBlock": "ignore", "AutoLink": "dummy", "Code": "dummy"}`

*Default:* `{}`

*Full type description:* <button class='expandable-button btn btn-default'>Click to show/hide</button>

<div markdown='1' style='display:none;'>

Object with arbitrary property names, where the value of each property has the following type:

- One of the following values:

  - `"default"`: The node is not treated specially.
  - `"ignore"`: The whole node together with its `Text` leaves is ignored.
  - `"dummy"`: The whole node together with its `Text` leaves is replaced with a dummy word (i.e., `Dummy0`, `Dummy1`, etc.). LTeX internally uses this mechanism for example for inline code (inside backticks) that is part of the sentence structure and for which LanguageTool would throw an error if simply omitted from the checked text.
  - `"pluralDummy"`: The whole node together with its `Text` leaves is replaced with a plural dummy word (i.e., `Dummies`). See description for `"dummy"`.
  - `"vowelDummy"`: The whole node together with its `Text` leaves is replaced with a vowel dummy word (i.e., `Ina`). See description for `"dummy"`.

If set to a non-empty string, LTeX will not use the bundled, built-in version of LanguageTool. Instead, LTeX will connect to an external [LanguageTool HTTP server](http://wiki.languagetool.org/http-server). Set this setting to the root URI of the server, and do not append `v2/check` or similar.

Note that in this mode, the settings [`ltex.additionalRules.languageModel`](settings.html#ltexadditionalruleslanguagemodel), [`ltex.additionalRules.neuralNetworkModel`](settings.html#ltexadditionalrulesneuralnetworkmodel), and [`ltex.additionalRules.word2VecModel`](settings.html#ltexadditionalrulesword2vecmodel) will not take any effect.

*Type:* `string`

*Example:* `"http://localhost:8081/"`

*Default:* `""`

## `ltex.languageToolOrg.username`

Username/email as used to log in at languagetool.org for Premium API access. Only relevant if [`ltex.languageToolHttpServerUri`](settings.html#ltexlanguagetoolhttpserveruri) is set.

*Type:* `string`

*Default:* `""`

## `ltex.languageToolOrg.apiKey`

API key for Premium API access. Only relevant if [`ltex.languageToolHttpServerUri`](settings.html#ltexlanguagetoolhttpserveruri) is set.

*Type:* `string`

*Default:* `""`

## `ltex.ltex-ls.path`

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

If set to an empty string, LTeX automatically downloads [ltex-ls from GitHub](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls/releases), stores it in the folder of the extension, and uses it for the checking process. You can point this setting to an ltex-ls release you downloaded by yourself.

Use the path to the root directory of ltex-ls (it contains `bin` and `lib` subdirectories).

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `string`

*Default:* `""`

## `ltex.ltex-ls.logLevel`

Logging level (verbosity) of the ltex-ls server log, which is accessible via `View` ‚Ä∫ `Output` ‚Ä∫ `LTeX Language Server`.

The levels in descending order are `"severe"`, `"warning"`, `"info"`, `"config"`, `"fine"`, `"finer"`, and `"finest"`. All messages that have the specified log level or a higher level are logged.

ltex-ls does not use all log levels.

*Type:* `string`

*Possible values:*

- `"severe"`: Minimum verbosity. Only log severe errors.
- `"warning"`: Very low verbosity. Only log severe errors and warnings.
- `"info"`: Low verbosity. Additionally, log startup and shutdown messages.
- `"config"`: Medium verbosity. Additionally, log configuration messages.
- `"fine"`: Medium to high verbosity (default). Additionally, log when LanguageTool is called or LanguageTool has to be reinitialized due to changed settings.
- `"finer"`: High verbosity. Log additional debugging information such as full texts to be checked.
- `"finest"`: Maximum verbosity. Log all available debugging information.

*Default:* `"fine"`

## `ltex.java.path`

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

If set to an empty string, LTeX uses a Java distribution that is bundled with ltex-ls. You can point this setting to an existing Java installation on your computer to use that installation instead.

Use the same path as you would use for the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable (it usually contains `bin` and `lib` subdirectories, amongst others).

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `string`

*Default:* `""`

## `ltex.java.initialHeapSize`

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

Initial size of the Java heap memory in megabytes (corresponds to Java's `-Xms` option, must be a positive integer).

Decreasing this might decrease RAM usage of the Java process.

Changes require restarting LTeX to take effect.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `integer`

*Default:* `64`

## `ltex.java.maximumHeapSize`

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

Maximum size of the Java heap memory in megabytes (corresponds to Java's `-Xmx` option, must be a positive integer).

Decreasing this might decrease RAM usage of the Java process. If you set this too small, the Java process may exceed the heap size, in which case an `OutOfMemoryError` is thrown.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `integer`

*Default:* `512`

## `ltex.sentenceCacheSize`

Size of the LanguageTool `ResultCache` in sentences (must be a positive integer).

If only a small portion of the text changed (e.g., a single key press in the editor), LanguageTool uses the cache to avoid rechecking the complete text. LanguageTool internally splits the text into sentences, and sentences that have already been checked are skipped.

Decreasing this might decrease RAM usage of the Java process. If you set this too small, checking time may increase significantly.

*Type:* `integer`

*Default:* `2000`

## `ltex.completionEnabled`

Controls whether completion is enabled (also known as auto-completion, quick suggestions, and IntelliSense).

If this setting is enabled, then a list of words is displayed that complete the currently typed word (whenever the editor sends a completion request).

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

In VS Code, completion is enabled by default while typing (via `editor.quickSuggestions`). Therefore, this setting is disabled by default, as constantly displaying completion lists might annoy the user. It is recommended to enable this setting, but disable `editor.quickSuggestions`. Then, LTeX completions can be requested by pressing `Ctrl+Space`.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `boolean`

*Default:* `false`

## `ltex.diagnosticSeverity`

Severity of the diagnostics corresponding to the grammar and spelling errors.

Controls how and where the diagnostics appear in Visual Studio Code. The possible severities are `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"information"`, and `"hint"`.

This setting can either be a string with the severity to use for all diagnostics, or an object with rule-dependent severities. If an object is used, each key is the ID of a LanguageTool rule and each value is one of the possible severities. In this case, the severity of other rules, which don't match any of the keys, has to be specified with the special key `"default"`.

*Type:* `string` or `object`

*Examples:*

- `"information"`
- `{"PASSIVE_VOICE": "hint", "default": "information"}`

*Default:* `"information"`

*Full type description:* <button class='expandable-button btn btn-default'>Click to show/hide</button>

<div markdown='1' style='display:none;'>

One of the following types:

- One of the following values:

  - `"error"`: Error diagnostics are usually underlined with a red squiggly line and appear in editor, minimap, Problems tab, and Explorer.
  - `"warning"`: Warning diagnostics are usually underlined with a yellow squiggly line and appear in editor, minimap, Problems tab, and Explorer.
  - `"information"`: Information diagnostics are usually underlined with a blue squiggly line and appear in editor, minimap, and Problems tab, but not in the Explorer.
  - `"hint"`: Hint diagnostics are not underlined (only subtly marked) and only appear in the editor, not in minimap, Problems tab, or Explorer.
- Object with arbitrary property names, where the value of each property has the following type:

  - One of the following values:

    - `"error"`: Error diagnostics are usually underlined with a red squiggly line and appear in editor, minimap, Problems tab, and Explorer.
    - `"warning"`: Warning diagnostics are usually underlined with a yellow squiggly line and appear in editor, minimap, Problems tab, and Explorer.
    - `"information"`: Information diagnostics are usually underlined with a blue squiggly line and appear in editor, minimap, and Problems tab, but not in the Explorer.
    - `"hint"`: Hint diagnostics are not underlined (only subtly marked) and only appear in the editor, not in minimap, Problems tab, or Explorer.

</div>

## `ltex.checkFrequency`

Controls when documents should be checked.

One of `"edit"`, `"save"`, and `"manual"`.

*Type:* `string`

*Possible values:*

- `"edit"`: Documents are checked when they are opened or edited (on every keystroke), or when the settings change.
- `"save"`: Documents are checked when they are opened or saved, or when the settings change.
- `"manual"`: Documents are not checked automatically, except when the settings change. Use commands such as [`LTeX: Check Current Document`](vscode-ltex/commands.html#ltex-check-current-document) to manually trigger checks.

*Default:* `"edit"`

## `ltex.clearDiagnosticsWhenClosingFile`

If set to `true`, diagnostics of a file are cleared when the file is closed.

*Type:* `boolean`

*Default:* `true`

## `ltex.statusBarItem`

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

If set to `true`, an item about the status of LTeX is shown permanently in the status bar.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `boolean`

*Default:* `false`

## `ltex.trace.server`

<!-- ltex-client-specific-begin -->

Debug setting to log the communication between language client and server.

When reporting issues, set this to `"verbose"` and open the `LTeX Language Client` log in `View` ‚Ä∫ `Output`. Append the relevant part to the GitHub issue.

Changes require restarting LTeX to take effect.

<!-- ltex-client-specific-end -->

*Type:* `string`

*Possible values:*

- `"off"`: Don't log any of the communication between language client and server.
- `"messages"`: Log the type of requests and responses between language client and server.
- `"verbose"`: Log the type and contents of requests and responses between language client and server.

*Default:* `"off"`
